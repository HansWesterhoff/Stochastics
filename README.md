# Welcome to the Systems Biology Amsterdam stochastics tutorial
This Github repository contains all materials related to a collection of stochastic/noise practicals taught as part of the systems biology and medicine course at CDAC (Como) 2021 in 2021. 

In this tutorial we will use [mybinder](http://mybinder.org/) to run [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the cloud.
The aims of the tutorial are:
1. To introduce you to basic programming in Python
2. Bring your conceptual understanding of stochastics modelling and transcription bursting into practice 
3. Prepare yourself for the lecture 'What if exception rules' 


# Important notes & tips
- It is critical that you **use a browser other than internet explorer: i.e. Google Chrome, Safari or Firefox.**

- **Your work is not saved on the server**. So manually export and download the workbooks if you want to keep them as explained in the first notebook.

- If you are inactive for a while (> 10 min) or randomly due to system errors, the system may quit your session. So when you take a break, **make sure you save and export the notebook you are working on first!**

- You can always go back and start the tutorial again or upload your saved files, on any computer at any time in the future.

- If the group size is large, it is recommended that you work in pairs to reduce server stress.

- If you run into problems, **ask one of the teaching assistants**. 


# Start the tutorial
To start the tutorial, **click on the "launch binder" button** at the top of this page. You will be redirected to a webpage that will generate a personal jupyter container for you. 

After a minute or two the notebook server will be launched. You will see a folder with files. 

**Then open the file you want to run either describing:

1. this tutorial as a whole ['Wff_course_CDAC_2021'], 
2. the section with the tutorial on notebook use ['0_running_code_in_notebook'], or
3. the section with the tutorial introducing you to the line-by-line programming language Python ['1-introduction_to_python])**.
