Simply click the \"Upload\" button in the top-right corner in Tree view and upload your saved notebook. \n\n### Table of Contents and Assignments\nAt the bottom of this page you will find a the table of contents linking to all the notebooks. **Return here when you finish each one**. \n\nThrough the various notebooks we have set up some assignments for you to complete. These are highlighted in red, with a time estimate for how long you should roughly spend on this, as follows:\n\n<span style=\"color:red\">**Assignment (3 min):**</span> Read the sections below.\n\n### Golden rule\n**<span style=\"color:red\">Golden rule:</span>** Ask one of the teaching assistants if anything is unclear!\n\nTo perform noise analysis in our tutorial you need to understand at least the basics of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. \n\nAs an introduction, the first two tutorials will cover the basics of the Jupyter notebook interface and Python. If you already have experience with Python feel free to skim (not skip) the first part. Even if you already have some experience there may be some tips and tricks in the first part that will come in handy later.\n\n\nHappy learning!\n\n\n## Table of Contents\nThe links below will take you to various parts of this tutorial. \n\n- [Getting to know the Jupyter notebook interface](./FBA_tutorials/0_running_code_in_notebook.ipynb) ~ 30 min\n- [Python essentials](./FBA_tutorials/1_introduction_to_python.ipynb) ~ 45 min\n\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernel_info":{"name":"python3"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.8","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"nteract":{"version":"0.12.3"},"toc":{"nav_menu":{},"number_sections":true,"sideBar":true,"skip_h1_title":false,"base_numbering":1,"title_cell":"Table of Contents","title_sidebar":"Contents","toc_cell":false,"toc_position":{},"toc_section_display":"block","toc_window_display":false}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
